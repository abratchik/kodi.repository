6. Click **OK** to save your changes
7. Press Esc to exit **File Manager** and open **Add-ons** menu.
8. Click **Install from zip file** (your Kodi may give you security warning, just ignore)
   and then select "Alex Bratchik Kodi Repo". Navigate to the folder 
   **matrix**, or 
   **leia**,
   depending on the version of your Kodi, and then open **repository.abratchik** folder.
9. You will see a zip file - for example **repository.abratchik-1.0.2.zip**. Click on it
   and install.
