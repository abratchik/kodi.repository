File Manager of your Kodi setup. The steps are below:

1. Navigate to the **System** menu and click on **File Manager**
2. Select **Add source**. 
3. Click on **None** and add the path **https://abratchik.github.io/kodi.repository/**.
4. Please ensure you entered the correct path for the version of your Kodi.
5. Enter a name for this media source - "Alex Bratchik Kodi Repo"
6. Click **OK** to save your changes
7. Press Esc to exit **File Manager** and open **Add-ons** menu.
8. Click **Install from zip file** (your Kodi may give you security warning, just ignore)
   and then select "Alex Bratchik Kodi Repo". Navigate to the folder 
   [Matrix](https://abratchik.github.io/kodi.repository/matrix/repository.abratchik/), or 
   [Leia](https://abratchik.github.io/kodi.repository/leia/repository.abratchik/),
   depending on the version of your Kodi.
9. You will see a zip file - for example **repository.abratchik-1.0.2.zip**. Click on it
   and install.
   
That's it.

If you want to shortcut these steps, you may also download the zip file directly

Kodi setup and install from there.
